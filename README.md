# MotherTode
This repository is currently an empty placeholder for my rewrite of the MotherTode language.

I'm currently in the process of making it as part of the Habitat library: https://github.com/l2wilson94/Habitat

When I've finished making it over there, I may or may not make a standalone version in this repository.

For more info on the language, check out the documentation: https://l2wilson94.gitbook.io/habitat/
